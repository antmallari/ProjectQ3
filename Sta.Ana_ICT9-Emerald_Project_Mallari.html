      <td>You should maintain a clean and organized building for a variety of reasons. One of the main causes is that a fire can spread more quickly when there is a lot of clutter, particularly flammable materials like paper, boxes, and other items. In the event of a fire, the clutter may also block exits and make it more difficult to escape. Therefore, be sure to maintain a tidy and clutter-free interior.</td>
